This is a Discoverable AIR Socket Server(ZaaMulti library) created in Flash Builder 4.6 with the Flex 4.6 API.
This can only be run on a Windows, Mac OSX, or Linux system, not mobile.

It's main purpose is to connect to a serproxy running on your machine. This server accepts 'clients' and exchanges information with the clients in order to turn on a LED on the Arduino.

I am releasing this code AS IS.
