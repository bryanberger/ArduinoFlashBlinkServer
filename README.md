This is a Discoverable AIR Socket Server(ZaaMulti library) created in Flash Builder 4.6 with the Flex 4.6 API.
This can only be run on a Windows, Mac OSX, or Linux system, not mobile.

It's main purpose is to connect to a serproxy running on your machine. This server accepts 'clients' and exchanges information with the clients in order to turn on a LED on the Arduino.

I am releasing this code AS IS.

How To:
-  Download serproxy here https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3590
-  Load your Arduino with StandardFirmata v2
-  Connect your Arduino via USB.
-  Launch this Application
-  Launch the Client Application
-  When Client connects to server, hit 'Blink'
